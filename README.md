- [Process]
(#my-process)
The process involved in completing this challenge only took the precise use of #flexbox tag.

  - [Builtwith]
    (#built-with)
    i used html and css to complete this challenge.
    I used basics of the followings:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Flexwrap

  - [Whatilearned]
    (#what-i-learned)
    I learned a better use of flexbox to give designs to our UI.

    Below are my favourite and most used elements throughout this challenge and i have provide a clip of the codings i would ponder upon if i looked back to this challenge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>div</h1>
"div" is my most used block element and i love this.
```

```css
.flex {
  color: white;gray;lightblue
}
```
I just loved the flex styling property and the respective colors mentioned above

```js
no javascript use{
  -----no javascript used-----
}
```

  - [Continued development](#continued-development)
  I really want to continue emphasizing on CSS, JS and React.

  (#useful-resources)
This project did not involve reading any article or taking help with tags through the internet.
I just gave myself time and did this as it is presented to you.
